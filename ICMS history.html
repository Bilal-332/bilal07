		<p>ICMS Education System was established in the year of 2005 with an ambition to provide affordable and high quality education with best modern infrastructure along with a realization of social responsibility. The vision of the chairman was to establish a unique educational institute having its own characteristics and environment that distinguishes it from other institute having its own characteristics and environment that distinguishes it from other institutions.<br><br><br>

		At ICMS, the entire community of students, teachers and their families, staff and servants share their problems, joys and sorrows. This develops an ethos where the school becomes a living and pulsating extended family. Residing and working together in an environment which is their home and abode, the interaction between the students, teacher and community as a whole, helps in the achievement of wider goals.</p>
